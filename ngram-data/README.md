# N-Gram data

*the results of running various n-gram scripts on the data*

* `output.txt` is the output of running `ngram2.py` on `iliad.txt`.
* `output-iliad.txt` is the output of running `ngram3.py` on `iliad2.txt`.
* `output-odyssey.txt` is the output of running `ngram3.py` on `odyssey2.txt`.
* `output-combined.txt` is the output of running `ngram3.py` on `combined2.txt`.
* `output-intersection.txt` is the lines of `output-combined.txt` with both Iliad and Odyssey references.



`iliad2.txt` and `odyssey2.txt` have line references marked. `ngram3.py` is similar to (although slower than) `ngram2.py` except it can track these references.
