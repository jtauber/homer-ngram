# N-Gram Processing

*code for calculating the repeated n-grams in a token list*

## Files

* `ngram.py` finds repeating n-grams in a token list
* `ngram2.py` like `ngram.py` but removes trivial subsequences of larger n-grams (see `subgram_removal.md`)
* `ngram3.py` like `ngram2.py` but takes a token list with references and returns those references with the n-gram results
* `ngram4.py` like `ngram3.py` but also returns offsets of token within the references

See `tutorial.md` for (the start of) a general walkthrough of this code.
